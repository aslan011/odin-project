# Employers can look here to see my work :)

## Synopsis

Begun around mid-March 2020,  this course will take me through HTML, CSS (inc. pre-processors/frameworks), Javascript (inc. libraries/frameworks) and using JS for the back-end through NodeJS. 

## In progress

Will return back to previously created tools/apps and improve them, maybe combining them into a single portfolio page...
